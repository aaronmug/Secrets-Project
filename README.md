# Secrets Project

This project is a simple website developed using Node.js and EJS to display random secrets fetched from the AppBrewery Random API. The purpose of this project is to learn how to make server-side requests using Axios in Node.js.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the server
```bash
    npm start
    ```
The application will be accessible at ** http://localhost:3000**.

## How it Works

When a user hovers over the secrets image on the website, the application makes an API request to the AppBrewery Random API using Axios.
The API responds with a random secret, which is displayed to the user.
